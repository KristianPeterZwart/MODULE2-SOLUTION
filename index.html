          compared to 10 grams of fat and 27 grams of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak. Dogs love Chicken too. </p>

        <p class="menu-item-description">
          Sushi is a popular Japanese dish made from seasoned rice with fish, egg, or vegetables. 
          A sushi roll is shaped inside a thin sheet of seaweed.
          Sushi comes from a Japanese word meaning "sour rice," and it's the rice that's at the heart of sushi, 
          even though most Americans think of it as raw fish. In fact, it's the word sashimi that refers to a piece of raw fish.</p>
